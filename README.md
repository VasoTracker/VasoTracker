An open source pressure myograph system and diameter tracking software for assessing vascular reactivity.

Pressure myographs are used to assess blood vessel function. Both smooth muscle cell contraction and relaxation can be assayed using the pressure myograph.

Commercial pressure myograph systems are expensive. Rather than buy one, we prefered to build our own, taking advantage of open-source technologies and cheap off-the-shelf components. 

If you want to build your own myograph system, or simply want to try our software with an existing system, give VasoTracker a try. Its cheap (well its free) and it works.

## Paper
A paper describing the system in full, and demonstrating its use for studying vascular activity will hopefully be published in the very near future. We will place a link to the paper here: [link](https://github.com/kaelome/VasoTracker)
